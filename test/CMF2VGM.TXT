CMF2VGM  Version 1.12  by NewRisingSun
--------------------------------------

CMF2VGM converts .CMF format files ("Creative Music File") into .VGM files.
It uses Creative's original SBFMDRV.COM to translate the MIDI-like .CMF file
data into OPL2/2xOPL2/OPL3 chip writes, which are logged into a .VGM file.

Usage:
1. Decide whether you want Sound Blaster 1.0/1.5, Sound Blaster Pro 1
   or Sound Blaster Pro 2/Sound Blaster 16 playback, and select the
   appropriate version of SBFMDRV.COM that is included in the CMF2VGM
   distribution.

   Sound Blaster 1.0/1.5:       111.COM/122.COM/130B.COM/134.COM
   Sound Blaster Pro 1:         130.COM
   Sound Blaster Pro 2/16:      132-02.COM/132-10.COM/133.COM

   See the comments below on the audible differences between the drivers.

2. Create a new directory and copy CMF2VGM.EXE, the correct version of
   SBFMDRV.COM, and the .CMF files you want to convert into that directory.

3. Run DOSBox and mount that directory you just created using the MOUNT
   command.

4. Switch DOSBox' FM emulation to the correct Sound Blaster type:

   Sound Blaster 1.0/1.5:       sbtype sb1
   Sound Blaster Pro 1:         sbtype sbpro1
   Sound Blaster Pro 2/16:      sbtype sbpro2

   Even as CMF2VGM converts as fast as the host machine allows and therefore
   does not actually output music data to the emulated Sound Blaster, some
   versions of SBFMDRV will still try to detect the particular card type used
   and adjust their behavior accordingly. CMF2VGM also detects the card type
   to determine whether to write OPL2, 2xOPL2 or OPL3 commands to the .VGM
   file. If you forget to set the card type correctly, DOSBox by default will
   emulate a Sound Blaster 16, so your .VGM files will be set up to use an
   OPL3 (YMF262) even though only OPL2 (YM3812) features are used.

5. Run the correct version of SBFMDRV.COM (see point 1). The driver will
   exit but remain in memory.

6. Run CMF2VGM with the name of the .CMF file(s) to be converted, e.g.
   CMF2VGM *.CMF. CMF2VGM will silently play the file through SBFMDRV and log
   the FM register writes to files with the same path/name stems and a .VGM
   name extension, e.g. STARFM.VGM.

7. That's it! The resulting .VGM files should require no trimming whatsoever.
   You may now add tags and run vgm_cmp to reduce its size by removing
   superfluous chip writes.

Background:
The .CMF file format was created by Creative Labs as a simplification of
AdLib's Visual Composer (.ROL) format. .ROL files have 44 tracks (notes,
instrument changes, volume changes, pitch change for eleven voices) and store
instrument data in a separate .BNK file. (The earliest versions did not even
support .BNK files, but stored each individual instrument in an .INS file!)
.CMF files contain only one track and embed the instrument data in the song
file itself, creating a file format that is much easier to handle.

.CMF itself supports all .ROL features except volume changes to an already-
playing note, which is used rarely. To my knowledge, Creative Labs never
released a music composition utility that directly created .CMF files.
Instead, they just provided a ROL2CMF utility so that people could compose
using the well-received AdLib Visual Composer, then convert the resulting
.ROL files into the .CMF format.

Comments:
Unfortunately, .CMF files will sound different in almost every version of
SBFMDRV.COM. Only the original versions 1.11 and 1.22 will reproduce the
volumes of .ROL files converted to .CMF somewhat accurately. Starting with
version 1.30, the driver would break the application of note velocities,
which results in an output almost completely devoid of any audible volume
changes (check out Jill of the Jungle's FUNKY.DDT). Version 1.11 has a bug
handling very low velocity levels and thus should not be used either.

Versions 1.30 to 1.32-02 will support stereo playback on a Sound Blaster Pro,
but since the .CMF format itself has no provisions for panning information,
the instruments are just placed at some default position that sounds good
with some files and terrible with others. I consider it more of a gimmick
than a feature. Apparently, Creative Labs had the same thought, and removed
stereo support from versions 1.32-10 and later.

For these reasons, I strongly recommend setting DOSBox to sbtype=sb1, and
using SBFMDRV version 1.22 for all conversions.
