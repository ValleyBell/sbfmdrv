# SBFMDRV disassemblies

This folder contains disassemblies of all known versions of the SBFMDRV.COM CMF sound driver.
Huge thanks to NewRisingSun for making them!

For version differences, see VERSIONS.TXT. (notes by NewRisingSun)  
For a list of bugs that the drivers have, see BUGS.md.


Version 1.20 was disassembled by Valley Bell.
It apparently was part of some SDK and thus this version was commonly embedded in DOS games.
This particular version was extracted from "Word Rescue" v1.0.
