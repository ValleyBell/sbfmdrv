Detailed differences:
111.COM ->122.COM:
- Add "fade" driver function and "main volume" functionality
- Add three additional internal driver functions (with negative function number)
- The "current song position" that is returned via driver function now always points to the beginning of an event, so that seeking always works.
- The "Vibrato depth" and "Tremolo depth" bits of register $BD are now always set; they were always clear before.
- Corrected an error setting the instrument of percussion instruments.
- Operators are now reset before setting the rhythm mode instead of afterwards.
- The Int 9 handler, which is written to silence the chip when pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, now queries the correct keyboard scancode.
- Slight correction to OPL write delay timing calculation.

122.COM->130-SBP1.COM (except for the obvious stereo functionality):
- Add "loop count" functionality and driver function.
- BUG: main volume is no longer applied properly, breaking fades
- MIDI velocities are now assumed to be linear, were previously assumed to be logarithmic. The conversion table used effectively almost completely removes any discernable note velocity differences.
- Add a lower boundary for the OPL write delay timing.
- Now use the BLASTER environment variable to set the base I/O address.

130-SBP1.COM->130B-SB.COM (except for the obvious lack of stereo functionality):
- Use the linear->logarithmic volume table for percussion notes as well.

130B-SB.COM->132-SBP2.COM (except for the obvious stereo functionality and card-specific valid range of BLASTER=A2xx value):
- A different assembler was used, that uses slightly different instruction encodings

132-SBP2->SB.COM->132-SB16.COM (except for card-specific valid range of BLASTER=A2xx value):
- NOTHING! The "Sound Blaster 16" driver is basically an OPL2 driver that just says "Sound Blaster 16", so no stereo support at all!

132-SB16.COM->133-SBP6.COM (except for card-specific valid range of BLASTER=A2xx value):
- Strange junk procedure (just PUSH AX/POP AX) after velocity table.
- Disable interrupts when writing to OPL chip.
- Add line feeds to a few messages.
- Allow I/O addresses outside the $2xx range (probably for MCV card).

133-SBP6.COM->134-SB.COM (except for card-specific valid range of BLASTER=A2xx value):
- Finally update the internal version number to a correct value (a little bit late...)
- Correct a bug in the "silence" procedure that wrote to an invalid register number.
- "silence" procedure: sets the release time of operators $10+ to maximum, apparently to prevent hanging notes on instruments with long release times, or something like that.
  Because this procedure is called when pausing a song, and these operators' register content is not automatically restored when continuing after pause,
  this introduces the bug that instruments become corrupted when continuing after pause.

Note: The .ASM files, when assembled with MASM 6.00A, will produce 100% byte-identical .COM files compared to the originals, EXCEPT for the two 1.34 drivers, because
      Creative used an (unknown) assembler that uses a different encoding for the CMP AL, AH/CMP AH,AL instructions.
