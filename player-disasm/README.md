# Creative Labs Player Executables

This folder contains CMF and MIDI playback programs.
Most of them were packed with Microsoft EXEPACK and thus had to be unpacked before disassembling.

The `unpacked` folder contains the decompressed executables.
Clive Turvey's UnPack tool was used for this task, which is included in `Unpack.zip`.

The disassemblies were done by Valley Bell.

## Original File names

I renamed most of the executables in order to include the version number.
The original file names were as follows:

- `PCMF` - `PLAYCMF.EXE`
- `PMID` - `PLAYMIDI.EXE`
- `PLAY` - `PLAY.EXE`
